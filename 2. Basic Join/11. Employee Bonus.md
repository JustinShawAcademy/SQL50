## 577. [Employee Bonus](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-bonus/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
* Easy Problem

### SQL Solution
#### Concepts / Syntax
`LEFT JOIN`

#### Intuition
We want **all** the employees that have a bonus less than `1000` or nothing. Since we want **all** the employees, we are going to have to do a `LEFT JOIN` of `Bonus` onto `Employee`. After that, we simply can filter using a `WHERE` clause to have employees only with a less than `1000` or nothing.

#### Approach
1. First, we start by `LEFT JOIN`ing `Bonus` onto `Employee`
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Bonus b
ON e.empId = b.empId
```
```
| empid | name   | supervisor | salary | empid | bonus |
| ----- | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 2     | Dan    | 3          | 2000   | 2     | 500   |
| 4     | Thomas | 3          | 4000   | 4     | 2000  |
| 1     | John   | 3          | 1000   | null  | null  |
| 3     | Brad   | null       | 4000   | null  | null  |
```

2. We filter the rows to employees that only have a bonus less than `1000` or nothing (NULL).
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Bonus b
ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus is NULL
```
```
| empid | name | supervisor | salary | empid | bonus |
| ----- | ---- | ---------- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 2     | Dan  | 3          | 2000   | 2     | 500   |
| 1     | John | 3          | 1000   | null  | null  |
| 3     | Brad | null       | 4000   | null  | null  |
```

3. Now we just select the name and bonus column
```sql
SELECT e.name, b.bonus
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Bonus b
ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus is NULL
```
```
| empId | bonus |
| ----- | ----- |
| 2     | 500   |
| 4     | 2000  |
```

#### Code
```sql
SELECT e.name, b.bonus
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Bonus b
ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus is NULL
```
