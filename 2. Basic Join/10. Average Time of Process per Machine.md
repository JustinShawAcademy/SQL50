## 1661. [Average Time of Process per Machine](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-time-of-process-per-machine/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
* Easy

### SQL Solution
#### Concepts / Syntax
`JOIN`, `GROUP BY`

#### Intuition
Join the Activity table with itself to get the start and end timestamp in the same row.
Apply GROUP BY to calculate averages.

#### Code
```sql
# Remember to round the average result
SELECT a1.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp), 3) as processing_time
FROM Activity a1 
JOIN Activity a2
ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id
AND a1.process_id = a2.process_id
AND a1.activity_type = "start"
AND a2.activity_type = "end"
GROUP BY a1.machine_id
```
